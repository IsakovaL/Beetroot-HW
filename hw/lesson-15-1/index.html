          <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will 
            spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. 
            The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level 
            statement of work. </p>
            <p>Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or 
            just the pieces you need. </p>
